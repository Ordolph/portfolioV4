##About

Simple game using bootstrap and jQuery. Users are prompted to start a new game, from there they will be assigned a random number between 1-100. Users can then click on the crystals at the bottom of the screen. Each crystal has a random assigned value between 1-12 which will be added to their score when clicked. The goal is to match the initial randomly generated number by clicking the crystals without going over.
