##About  



This is a react app that I built to better learn react. It imports the latest popular movies from the tmdb database through their open api, and dynamically renders movie cards that when clicked direct the user to a plot summary page that is also dynamically rendered. Created following a tutorial by Scott Tolinski at leveluptutorials.com
