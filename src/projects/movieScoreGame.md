## About

This is a basic "Trivia Game" that uses TMDB and OMDB to gather 10 random popular movies, along with their posters and Rotten Tomatoes scores. The objective of this game is to guess the Tomatoes score as closely as possible. Press "start" to begin, you will then have 15 seconds on each movie to enter the score in the input box. You will get a number of points equal to the difference between your score, and the correct score. At the end of the game, you can input a name and be added to the leaderboard (leaderboard uses firebase). Currently the hosted version does not work due to CORES issues.
