## About

Neighborly is a full stack message board built in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) that provides neighbors with a way to easily communicate and get to know each other. Users can create a new account, log-in, and then view the message board. On the message board are multiple different categories from tool sharing, to community events. The user can create a new post, or respond with a direct message to the creators of any of the posts. Messages will be sent directly to the users inbox, and replied to from there.
All communities are currently on a per zip code basis, however a feature to allow users to draw their own community lines is planned for the future.
