## About

Bamazon is a node cli app that uses sequelize and my sql to store and retrieve data, and node inquirer and cli-tables for the user interface. There are three different kinds of users: customers, supervisors, and managers, all who have different abilities within the app. Users can buy items from the store. Supervisors can view sales values by department, or add new departments. Managers can view products that have low inventory, order new stock for existing items, or add new items to the store.
